# LIBBLE-DisPyTorch
LIBBLE-DisPyTorch is the LIBBLE variant implemented on Pytorch.  
PyTorch is a deep learning framework for fast, flexible experimentation.Howeverï¼ŒPyTorch only provides an MPI-like interface for exchanging tensor data across multi-machine networks.  
To handle different kinds of application scenarios, we design and develop three distributed deep learning frameworks on PyTorch: MR-DisPyTorch, RA-DisPyTorch and PS-DisPyTorch. Users can choose suitable framework according to their specific need in real applications.
